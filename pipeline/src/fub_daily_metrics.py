"""
Daily operational activity metrics derived from the FUB /v1/people endpoint.

This is the **daily pulse** counterpart to the monthly Zillow Preferred report.
Where ``src/fub_client.py`` queries a (mostly nonexistent) aggregate reporting
endpoint, this module computes metrics directly from per-lead data so we can
run it hourly or daily without depending on FUB's UI-only Performance Report.

Window
------
Each run measures **month-to-date**: leads with ``created >= start of the
current calendar month``. Today / This Week views are derived by the dashboard
by diffing snapshots from different days — keeps storage simple and idempotent.

Metric set (the 8 daily metrics + activity points)
--------------------------------------------------
Data sources follow FUB Open API guidance (dedicated endpoints preferred):

- ``response_time_seconds``      avg seconds from lead created to first contact     [/people]
- ``contact_rate``               fraction of leads with contacted=1                 [/people]
- ``pickup_rate``                fraction of Zillow calls that connected (≥10s)     [/people proxy]
- ``appointment_rate``           appointments set / total Zillow leads               [/appointments]
- ``lead_acceptance_rate``       fraction of leads moved past 'New' (stage>26)      [/people]
- ``call_volume``                outbound call attempts                              [/calls]
- ``texts_sent``                 outbound texts sent (person aggregate fallback)     [/people]
- ``emails_sent``                outbound emails sent (person aggregate fallback)    [/people]
- ``conversations_2min``         outbound calls with duration >= 120s               [/calls]
- ``appointments_set``           count of appointments created in the period         [/appointments]
- ``new_leads_not_acted_on``     count of leads with stageId == 26 and contacted=0  [/people]
- ``total_zillow_leads``         count of filtered Zillow Preferred leads            [/people]
- ``activity_points``            weighted leaderboard score (see POINTS below)

When /calls or /appointments return 404/403 the module falls back to person-level
aggregates so daily pulls continue even if those endpoints aren't enabled.

Activity-point weights match the gamification scheme:
    Appointments Set     × 500
    Conversations 2+ min × 100
    Call Attempts        × 10
    Texts Sent           × 2
    Emails Sent          × 1

What "Zillow Preferred lead" means
----------------------------------
A lead is counted when either source == 'Zillow Preferred' (case-insensitive
match) or sourceId == 14. Belt-and-suspenders against FUB tenant-specific
labeling drift.

Response-time approximation
---------------------------
FUB's person record exposes ``firstCall`` (timestamp of the first call ever
placed to this person), plus ``lastSentText`` and ``lastSentEmail`` (the most
recent outbound text/email). We take the earliest non-null of those three and
subtract ``created``. That's a conservative proxy — if an agent texted the lead
multiple times, we measure to the *last* text, biasing the number upward. The
fully correct path would be ``/v1/events?personId=...`` per lead, but that's
~N more API calls per agent per run. Acceptable for a daily-pulse view.
